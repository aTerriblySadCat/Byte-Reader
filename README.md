# Byte Reader
A tool that can dump specific parts of a file (on a byte by byte level) to Console in both Unicode and Hexadecimal format.

## But why?
It is designed with the purpose of being able to easily find specific parts of very large files. Files commonly too large for regular text editors.

An example of such files are VM hard disk files.
